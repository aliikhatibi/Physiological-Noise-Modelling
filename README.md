### Here you can find tools for reading output files from PMU of MRI machines. 

These tools help you to read two main group of files (resp recording and heartbeat usually acquired by a pulse-oximeter) and create regressors to include in your analysis. You can also use the output files as input for PNM tool implemented in FSL. 

* Notice that the existing code is available for files acquired from Siemens machines. Codes for other machines will be added soon.
